"""Data-loader recipe — JAXTPC sensor DENSE path (densify + add noise on GPU).

CAMPAIGN.md (JAXTPC): the sensor readout is loaded SPARSE in the worker, moved to
the GPU, then densified to per-plane images and given fresh intrinsic noise
(JAXTPC production omits coherent noise by default, so it's added at load). This is
the only recipe that exercises the post-collate dense ops.

It is ONE `transform` list (map -> reduce -> map). `Collect` is the reduce
boundary: everything up to it runs per-event in the DataLoader workers (sparse —
only sparse crosses PCIe); everything after runs per-batch **after collate**, with
`ToDevice` as the device step so `Densify`/`AddNoise`/`Digitize` (the single
dispatching dense ops — no `Batch*`, no policy dict) run on the GPU and the grids
are born on-device. The dataset splits the list at `Collect`: the head is
`dataset.transform` (per-event), the tail is `dataset.batch_transform`, which a
trainer runs post-collate (e.g. `on_after_batch_transfer`).

Batch after the head + collate:  sensor_wire/time/value/plane_gid (ΣM,), sensor_offset.
After the tail (batch_transform): sensor_dense = {plane_gid: (B, W, T)} (noisy, digitized).
